* Write utility to recursively `go get` repositories, setting the revisions back
  to a specified date before recursing.
* Use godep to then dump all revisions to a Godeps.json file.
* New utility to take a Godeps.json file and generate a nix experssion that
  bundles all deps, setting $GOPATH appropriately, and invoking `go install`.
* Add new packages to Nixpkgs :)
